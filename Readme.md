# How to use the Papermill Alarm

There are 2 ways to use the Papermill Alarm API. 

1. You can simply subscribe to the 'POST Single Documents' route of the API. This will allow you to manually submit docs one at a time. This is easy to do, but adds up to a lot of work over time. 

2. You can adapt the code in the attached notebook to create an automated daily search of your new submissions using the 'POST Batches' route. This is much faster.

Before you begin, you need to

- [subscribe to the API](https://rapidapi.com/clear-skies-clear-skies-default/api/papermill-alarm)
- enter your API Key as an environment variable
- THEN open up the attached jupyter notebook by opening a terminal at this location and typing 'jupyter notebook'
- then follow the instructions!
