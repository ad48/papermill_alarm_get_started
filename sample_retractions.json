MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of multiple cellular processes, and the aberrant miRNAs expressions have been observed in different types of cancer including HCC. Their pathysiologic role and their relevance to tumorigenesis are still largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated the down-regulation of miR-424 in HCC cell lines and tissues by quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Overexpression of miR-424 reduced the HCC cell prolifetation, migration, and invasion. Conversely, inhibiton of miR-424 expression significantly accelerated the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, we further identified c-Myb as a functional downstream target of miR-424 by directly targeting the 3'UTR of c-Myb. Furthermore, overexpression of c-Myb impaired miR-424-induced inhibition of proliferation and invasion in HCC cells. Our results demonstrated that miR-424 was involved in tumorigenesis of HCC at least in part by suppression of c-Myb.

Identifying precise prognostic markers and effective therapeutic targets is important in the treatment of gastric cancer. microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate gastric cancer metastasis remain poorly understood. In this study, we found that the levels of miR-410 in gastric cancer and cell lines were much lower than that in the normal control, respectively, and the lower level of miR-410 was significantly associated with lymph-node metastasis. Transfection of miR-410 mimics could significantly inhibit the cell proliferation, migration and invasion in the HGC-27 gastric cancer cell lines. In contrast, knockdown of miR-410 had the opposite effect on the cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Moreover, we also found that MDM2 was negatively regulated by miR-410 at the post-transcriptional level, via a specific target site with the 3'UTR by luciferase reporter assay. The expression of MDM2 was inversely correlated with miR-410 expression in gastric cancer tissues, and overexpression of MDM2 in miR-410-transfected gastric cancer cells effectively rescued the inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion caused by miR-410. Thus, our findings suggested that miR-410 acted as a new tumor suppressor by targeting the MDM2 gene and inhibiting gastric cancer cells proliferation, migration and invasion. The findings of this study contributed to the current understanding of these functions of miR-410 in gastric cancer.

Osteosarcoma causes large number of deaths because of its complex pathogenesis and resistance to conventional treatment. MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that function as critical gene regulators through targeting mRNAs, causing translational repression or degradation. In this study, we showed that miR-217 was down-regulated in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues in comparison to that in normal bone cells or tissues. Meanwhile, the lower level of miR-217 was associated with metastasis in clinical osteosarcoma patients. Furthermore, we found that overexpession of miR-217 markedly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. Conversely, the inhibition of miR-217 expression significantly accelerated the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, we identified WASF3 as a novel functional downstream target of miR-217. The ectopic expression of WASF3 can partially reverse the inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion caused by miR-217.

Moreover, the higher level of miR-137 was associated with pM or pTNM stage in clinical bladder cancer patients. Enforced expression of miR-137 in bladder cancer cells significantly enhanced their proliferation, migration and invasion.

HMG\u2011box transcription factor 1 (HBP1) was identified as a novel target of miR\u2011155, which mediated its effect on CRC via the Wnt/\u03b2\u2011catenin pathway. Furthermore, patients with CRC exhibiting higher serum levels of miR\u2011155 exhibited reduced survival rates. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that miR\u2011155 may contribute to the progression and growth of CRC by enhancing the Wnt/\u03b2\u2011catenin pathway in an HBP1\u2011associated mechanism. Therefore, miR\u2011155 may be considered a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC.

Bioinformatics analysis revealed the targeted relationship between miR-195 and the 3'-UTR of YAP1. This study investigated the role of miR-195 in regulating YAP1 expression and affecting proliferation and apoptosis of esophageal cancer cells.The tumor tissue and the adjacent tissue of patients with esophageal cancer were collected to detect the expressions of miR-195 and YAP1. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was adopted to validate the targeted regulation between miR-195 and YAP1. Esophageal cancer EC9706 cells and normal esophageal epithelial HEEC cells were cultured in vitro to measure the expression of miR-195 and YAP1. EC9706 cells were divided into miR-NC group and miR-195 mimic group followed by analysis of cell apoptosis by flow cytometry and cell proliferation by EdU staining.Compared with adjacent tissues, miR-195 was significantly decreased, while YAP1 mRNA and protein were significantly upregulated in esophageal cancer tissues. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that there was a targeted relationship between miR-195 and YAP1. Compared with HEEC cells, miR-195 expression was declined, whereas YAP1 was elevated in EC9706 cells. Transfection of miR-195 mimic significantly downregulated YAP1 expression, resulting in increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation of EC9706 cells.Decreased expression of miR-195 plays a regulatory role in increasing YAP1 expression and promoting the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer. Elevation of miR-195 inhibites the expression of YAP1, restrains cell proliferation, and promotes cell apoptosis.

Abnormal down-regulation of miR-141 is associated with gastric cancer pathogenesis, suggesting a potentially tumor suppressor role. Bioinformatics analysis found complementary binding sites between miR-141 and YP1. This study investigated the role of miR-141 in mediating YAP1 expression and biological behavior of gastric cancer cells. Gastric cancer tissues were collected using normal mucosal tissues as the control. qRT-PCR compared expression of miR-141 and YAP1 mRNA, and western blot quantified YAP1 protein expression. Spearman approach analyzed the correlation between miR-141 and YAP1 mRNA in cancer tissues. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed the targeted regulation between miR-141 and YAP1. Using GES-1 cell as the control, miR-141 and YAP1 expression were measured in gastric cancer cell lines SGC7901 and MGC03. Those cells were transfected with miR-141 mimic in the presence or absence of miR-YAP1 mimic followed by flow cytometry for apoptosis and EdU staining for proliferation. Cancer tissues had decreased miR-141 and higher YAP1 expression, which was associated with TNM stage. YAP1 mRNA and miR-141 were positively correlated (r=-0.623, P<0.001). Dual luciferase assay demonstrated targeted regulation between miR-141 and YAP1. Comparing to GES-1 cells, SGC7901 and MGC803 cells had decreased miR-141 and increased YAP1 expression. Transfection of miR-141 mimic inhibited YAP1 expression or cell proliferation and facilitated apoptosis.

Bioinformatics analysis and double luciferase reporter gene test were used to verify the relationship between miR-195 and MEK1. Bladder cancer BIU-87 and 5637 cells were cultured in vitro and divided into two groups: miR-NC group and miR-195 mimic group. The expression of MEK1 and p-MEK1 protein was detected by western blot, apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, and cell proliferation was detected by EdU staining.Compared with normal bladder tissue, expression of miR-195 in bladder cancer tissue was significantly decreased, while the expression of MEK1 mRNA and protein was significantly increased. The prognosis of patients with low expression of miR-195 was worse than those with high expression of miR-195. The prognosis of patients with low expression of MEK1 was better than those with high expression of MEK1. Bioinformatics analysis showed that there was a target complementary binding site between miR-195 and MEK1. Double luciferase reporter gene experiments confirmed that there was a target regulatory relationship between miR-195 and MEK1. miR-195 mimic transfection could significantly down-regulate the expression of MEK1 and p-MEK1 proteins in BIU-87 and 5637 cells, weaken cell proliferation, and increase cell apoptosis.Overexpression of miR-195 can inhibit the proliferation of bladder cancer cells by inhibiting MEK1, which provides further evidence for developing therapy against bladder cancer.

METTL3 expression in patients with different tumor lymph node metastasis (TNM) stages was detected by qRT-PCR as well. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the interplay between METTL3 expression and the prognosis of patients with NPC. At the same time, METTL3 expression in normal epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) and NPC cell lines (SUNE-1 and C666-1) was examined using qRT-PCR. After METTL3 was knocked down in SUNE-1 cells, cell viability and migration abilities were analyzed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) test and wound healing assay, respectively. The mRNA and protein expressions of EZH2 were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively.

Meanwhile, METTL3 expression in T3 and T4 tumors was significantly higher than that of T1 and T2 tumors. In patients with lymph node metastasis, the expression of METTL3 was remarkably higher than those without metastasis. Survival analysis demonstrated that patients with higher expression of METTL3 exhibited significantly longer overall survival time than those with lower METTL3 expression.

After knockdown of EZH2, the mRNA level of CDKN1C in SUNE-1 cells was significantly up-regulated. CHIP assay indicated that EZH2 could bind to CDKN1C. Western blot showed that, after interfering with METTL3 in SUNE-1 cells, the protein expression of EZH2 decreased significantly, while CDKN1C was up-regulated.
